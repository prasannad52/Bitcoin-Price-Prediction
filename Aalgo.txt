âœ… **Bitcoin Investment Pathfinding Using A\* (Conceptual + Simple Python Example)**

We'll simulate a decision-making problem:

* **States:** Each state represents a day in the dataset and whether you currently "hold Bitcoin" or "hold cash."
* **Actions:** Buy, Sell, Hold.
* **Cost:** Negative of profit (since A\* minimizes cost).
* **Heuristic:** Future price trend (e.g., projected price increase or decrease).

---

### **Example with Dataset (Simplified)**

#### **Dataset (example CSV):**

```csv
Date,Price
2024-06-01,25000
2024-06-02,25500
2024-06-03,26000
2024-06-04,24500
2024-06-05,27000
```

### **Python Skeleton Code for A\* Trading Simulation**

```python
import pandas as pd
import heapq

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('bitcoin_prices.csv')

# State representation: (day_index, holding_status) 
# holding_status: True = holding Bitcoin, False = holding cash

class Node:
    def __init__(self, day, holding, profit, path):
        self.day = day
        self.holding = holding
        self.profit = profit
        self.path = path  # list of actions taken

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.profit > other.profit  # For max profit, invert comparison


def heuristic(current_day, holding, data):
    # Simple heuristic: price difference between current day and last day
    if current_day >= len(data) - 1:
        return 0
    future_price = data['Price'].iloc[-1]
    current_price = data['Price'].iloc[current_day]
    
    return future_price - current_price if holding else 0


def astar_trading(data):
    n = len(data)
    start_node = Node(day=0, holding=False, profit=0, path=[])

    queue = []
    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start_node))

    best_profit = float('-inf')
    best_path = []

    while queue:
        _, current = heapq.heappop(queue)

        if current.day == n - 1:
            if current.profit > best_profit:
                best_profit = current.profit
                best_path = current.path
            continue

        next_day = current.day + 1
        price_today = data['Price'].iloc[current.day]
        price_next = data['Price'].iloc[next_day]

        # Possible actions:
        
        # 1. Hold
        heapq.heappush(queue, (
            - (current.profit + heuristic(next_day, current.holding, data)),
            Node(next_day, current.holding, current.profit, current.path + ['Hold'])
        ))

        if not current.holding:
            # 2. Buy
            heapq.heappush(queue, (
                - (current.profit + heuristic(next_day, True, data)),
                Node(next_day, True, current.profit - price_today, current.path + ['Buy'])
            ))
        else:
            # 3. Sell
            heapq.heappush(queue, (
                - (current.profit + price_today + heuristic(next_day, False, data)),
                Node(next_day, False, current.profit + price_today, current.path + ['Sell'])
            ))

    return best_profit, best_path


# Example Usage
profit, actions = astar_trading(data)
print(f"Best Profit: {profit}")
print(f"Actions Taken: {actions}")
```

### âœ… **Notes:**

* This is a **simplified conceptual version**.
* You can improve:

  * Heuristic: Use actual technical indicators (like RSI, MACD).
  * State Space: Add available cash, Bitcoin amount, etc.
  * Transaction costs, realistic constraints.
* Not for **real-world trading**, but good for understanding **decision path planning using A\***.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This approach applies A\* as a **planning tool**, framing Bitcoin trading as a **search problem** through different possible actions. It helps find an optimal action sequence to maximize profit.

---

If you want, I can help:
âœ… Modify this for your full dataset.
âœ… Add realistic features like technical indicators.
âœ… Create a complete project structure with graphs.

**Do you want me to help with that?** ðŸš€
To **mathematically solve the A\*** approach for your Bitcoin dataset, let's break down the **exact steps** using a small dataset and compute the optimal solution manually like A\* would do.

---

### âœ… **Assumed Bitcoin Dataset (5 Days)**

| Day | Price (â‚¹) |
| --- | --------- |
| 0   | 25,000    |
| 1   | 25,500    |
| 2   | 26,000    |
| 3   | 24,500    |
| 4   | 27,000    |

### âœ… **A\* Mathematical Search Simulation**

#### **Definitions:**

* States: `(day, holding status)`
* Actions: Buy, Sell, Hold
* Profit is updated after each action.
* Heuristic (h(n)): Predicted additional profit (simple version: future price difference)
* Cost-to-date (g(n)): Actual profit/loss so far
* Total Cost `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (since we are maximizing profit, invert cost for A\*)

---

### âœ… **Step-by-Step Simulation**

**Start State:**

```
(day = 0, holding = False, profit = 0), Path: []
```

---

#### **Day 0 Options:**

1. **Hold**

```
(day = 1, holding = False, profit = 0), Path: [Hold]
h(n) = 27,000 - 25,500 = 1,500
f(n) = 0 + 1,500 = 1,500
```

2. **Buy**

```
(day = 1, holding = True, profit = -25,000), Path: [Buy]
h(n) = 27,000 - 25,500 = 1,500
f(n) = -25,000 + 1,500 = -23,500
```

Best node: **Hold**, f(n) = 1,500

---

### âœ… **Day 1 (holding = False, profit = 0)**

Options:

1. **Hold**

```
(day = 2, holding = False, profit = 0), Path: [Hold, Hold]
h(n) = 27,000 - 26,000 = 1,000
f(n) = 0 + 1,000 = 1,000
```

2. **Buy**

```
(day = 2, holding = True, profit = -25,500), Path: [Hold, Buy]
h(n) = 27,000 - 26,000 = 1,000
f(n) = -25,500 + 1,000 = -24,500
```

Best node: **Hold**, f(n) = 1,000

---

### âœ… **Day 2 (holding = False, profit = 0)**

Options:

1. **Hold**

```
(day = 3, holding = False, profit = 0), Path: [Hold, Hold, Hold]
h(n) = 27,000 - 24,500 = 2,500
f(n) = 0 + 2,500 = 2,500
```

2. **Buy**

```
(day = 3, holding = True, profit = -26,000), Path: [Hold, Hold, Buy]
h(n) = 27,000 - 24,500 = 2,500
f(n) = -26,000 + 2,500 = -23,500
```

Best node: **Hold**, f(n) = 2,500

---

### âœ… **Day 3 (holding = False, profit = 0)**

Options:

1. **Hold**

```
(day = 4, holding = False, profit = 0), Path: [Hold, Hold, Hold, Hold]
h(n) = 0 (last day)
f(n) = 0
```

2. **Buy**

```
(day = 4, holding = True, profit = -24,500), Path: [Hold, Hold, Hold, Buy]
h(n) = 0
f(n) = -24,500
```

Best node: **Hold**, f(n) = 0

---

### âœ… **Day 4 Final State (holding = False, profit = 0)**

Since no Bitcoin held, total profit = â‚¹0.

---

### âœ… **Alternate Path: Buy on Day 3**

**If you Buy on Day 3**, path:

```
[Hold, Hold, Hold, Buy]
```

At Day 4:

* Holding = True
* Profit = -24,500

**Sell on Day 4:**

```
Profit = -24,500 + 27,000 = â‚¹2,500
```

So:

* Path: \[Hold, Hold, Hold, Buy, Sell]
* Final Profit: â‚¹2,500

---

### âœ… **Best Optimal Path Found:**

| Action | Day | Description     |
| ------ | --- | --------------- |
| Hold   | 0   | Wait            |
| Hold   | 1   | Wait            |
| Hold   | 2   | Wait            |
| Buy    | 3   | Buy at â‚¹24,500  |
| Sell   | 4   | Sell at â‚¹27,000 |

**Total Profit: â‚¹2,500**

---

### âœ… **Mathematically Optimal Solution**

The **A\*** search guides us to:
âœ” Buy on Day 3 at â‚¹24,500
âœ” Sell on Day 4 at â‚¹27,000
âœ” Total Profit: â‚¹2,500

---

### âœ… **Conclusion**

This is the optimal solution using A\* logic, mathematically computed for your small dataset.

---

### Do you want me to:

âœ… Extend this logic to your real, larger dataset?
âœ… Give full Python code that calculates this automatically?
âœ… Modify heuristic for more realistic trading scenarios?
